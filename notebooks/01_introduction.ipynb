    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the introduction to the half-day tutorial on the Satpy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satpy is a python library that can be used to work with various earth-observing satellite instrument data. Satpy is the result of multiple projects, including Pytroll mpop and CSPP Polar2Grid, combining efforts to build a better project. Development of the Satpy library started in late 2015 and has been designed to assist scientists and researchers in working these data. One of the main original goals and use cases was to generate high quality, high resolution imagery as quickly as possible. Over the years following its creation, Satpy has grown to support more use cases while also working on compatibility with other open source python tools. The high level functionality of Satpy includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reading data files\n",
    "- compositing data products together (ex. RGB images)\n",
    "- resampling data to new geographic projections\n",
    "- writing data to on-disk formats\n",
    "- using the data with other python-based visualization tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is made up of multiple Jupyter notebooks and as a whole will provide an overview of the Satpy library; what it can do and how to use it. Throughout the tutorial we'll use Satpy to read and analyze real satellite instrument data. We'll go over the breadth of features provided by Satpy and leave detailed scientific analysis as an exercise for the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: If you are unable to properly set up a local environment to run the notebooks, be aware that these examples can also be run interactively in the cloud using [Pangeo's BinderHub](http://pangeo-data.org) through a JupyterLab interface. See the [README](https://github.com/pytroll/tutorial-satpy-half-day/blob/master/README.rst) file of this repository for more information (repository linked below)."
