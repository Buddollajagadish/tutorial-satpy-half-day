    "So far in this tutorial we've dealt with only one time step at a time. However, we also discussed that one of the main benefits of geostationary data is its temporal resolution. It can provide us with many images of the same location quickly. Let's explore this property by making a MPEG4 video of GOES-16 ABI Mesoscale data. Due to time constraints and the time it takes to do this processing we'll be using 1-minute data only over one hour (2018-05-11 21:00Z to 2018-05-11 22:00Z)."

    "Normally if we wanted to operate on 960 input files (60 time steps for ABI), we'd have to sort every 16 files and then create `Scene` objects for each one. Satpy provides a helper class called the `MultiScene` to help with this and other operations that you might want to do on multiple `Scene` objects at once. One way to create a `MultiScene` is to use its `from_files` class method. This will sort the files based on time and other properties to make sure that each time step has its own Scene and can be operated on as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that to improve performance the `MultiScene` operates on \"generators\" internally. Generators can be a complex subject, but basically this means that, similar to dask arrays, we don't perform operations on each `Scene` when requested. Instead we build up a series of operations to apply and do them when needed. For this reason, it is suggested that MultiScenes not be used for \"exploring\" data where you would normally access many properties on a Scene.\n",
