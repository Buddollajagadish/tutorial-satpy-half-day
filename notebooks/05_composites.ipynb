    "Meteorological satellite instrument bands provide a look at the Earth at various wavelengths. Each band represents the electro-magnetic radiation observed at one wavelength or range of wavelengths. While this is very useful, flexible, and requires a very limited amount of processing to visualize, it does require that the viewer know what to expect from each band or wavelength. In addition to viewing individual bands, another common option for viewing satellite data is to combine multiple bands in to one image such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images. By assigning certain bands to particular channels in the output RGB image we can provide an easy way to identify features in the data. Instead of having to know what a particular wavelength is sensitive to, we can now focus on what colors in particular RGB recipe mean.\n",
