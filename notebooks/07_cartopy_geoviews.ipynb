Overall we will be using features provided by the matplotlib library for plotting, cartopy for coastlines and geographic coordinate handling, and xarray for some utility in plotting our data. The main feature Satpy, or rather Pyresample, brings to the table is the `to_cartopy_crs` method to convert our `AreaDefinition` to a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) object that cartopy can understand.\n",

In this case, they are the same so no resampling has to happen.\n",
